         <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;">
                Some benefits can be bestowed by causing people to exist; their existence is dependent on the act of bestowing the benefit itself. Derek Parfit argued that benefiting a person who will exist independently of one's act and bestowing the same amount of benefit by causing the person to exist are equally worthwhile. Jeff McMahan, however, responded that there is an asymmetry between them since the former can have a “bitter thought” when the latter is prioritized. I offer multiple interpretations of McMahan's argument, and it is argued that Parfit's view still stands.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;"><i>Aidan Penn (Oxford): "The Rights of Future People"</i></p>
         <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;">
             Suppose that you can benefit others by causing person X to exist with a bad life. Many think that it would be wrong for you to do so, even if the benefits to others are large enough that things would go better if you caused X to exist. In my talk, I will consider how non-consequentialists can defend this view. I will argue—pace Parfit, McMahan, and several others—that non-consequentialists have three options for explaining the wrongness of causing X to exist. First, they can maintain that merely possible persons’ rights can generate duties for existing persons; second, they can permit certain violations of normative invariance; third, they can maintain that you have a duty not to cause X to exist because of a consistency constraint on moral agency, not because of X’s rights. I will suggest that the third option is more plausible than the first two.</p>

         <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;">
             Philosophers have had a difficult time defending the highly intuitive Procreation Asymmetry. This is the sense that we have strong moral reasons to refrain from creating people with lives not worth living, but no moral reasons to create people just because their lives would be worth living. Johann Frick argues this difficulty is due to a mistaken view about the nature of our reasons to benefit, and that taking our reasons to benefit a person to be conditional on their existence (or bearer-dependent) allows him to do better. I contend that his argument for the bearer-dependence of our reasons to benefit generalizes to all welfare-related reasons, and consequently, undermines the second half of the Asymmetry.</p>


        
         <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;"><i>Tomi Francis (Oxford): "Population Axiology Without Identity" </i></p>
         <p class="paragraph_style_4" style="line-height: 20.9px;">
                Standard population axiologies implicitly refer to the personal identity relation, by taking populations to be sets of lives. This is incompatible with the idea that identity does not matter. Instead, we should formulate our theories without appealing to personal identity. Call the project of taking standard theories and rewriting them in terms which make no reference to personal identity "R-translation". In this talk, I consider the following questions: (1) Is there a general method for R-translating standard population axiologies?; (2) Is there, for each standard population axiology, an R-translation?; (3) Is there always a uniquely appropriate R-translation?</p>
